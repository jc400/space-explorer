# Space Explorer

Space Explorer is a simple Python platformer. You control Unnamed Astronaut, who must rescue their loyal cow June from marauding aliens. 

# Installation

The game is written entirely in native Python, with no external dependencies, so installing should be easy. Just `git clone https://github.com/jc400/space-explorer` , and then run space_explorer.py from that directory. I've tested with Python 3.8, but it should work on other versions.
